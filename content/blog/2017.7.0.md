### Other Updates

* We have continued updating the new [Beta site](https://glowstone.net/)
    * The Beta site is a completely [open-source](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Site) initiative.
    * More information can be found in the [official announcement](/news/new-site-beta/).
* **Important:** Due to a possible intrusion of our forums database, we recommend you reset your account password on the forums
    * Multiple issues with our Redis database and Proxmox virtualization system have lead to a complete external exposure of its contents (including email addresses and bcrypt-hashed passwords).
    * All data between June 18 and July 25 has been lost due to a technical failure.
    * Please read our [report](/news/intrusion-report-forums/) on the intrusion. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or concerns about this.

### Coming Soon
I have personally been working on implementing pathfinding for Entity AI. After several months of on-and-off work on this issue, I have found an efficient solution to implement it, and I am aiming to have it all functional for the next release (2017.8).

We are continuously updating our Beta site with new features, and we are looking forward to your feedback. We are planning to have a complete 'Download Center' for Glowstone on there in the near future!
