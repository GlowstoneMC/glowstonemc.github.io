Yep, that's right. We've moved from Flarum.

From a personal perspective, Flarum doesn't appear to be going anywhere fast. In its current early-beta state, it doesn't have many options, has questionable levels of security and is impossible to upgrade. As a result, we quickly outgrew it. It was time to move on - At least until Flarum becomes viable.

So, we're now on NodeBB. The previous posts haven't been moved over, but a backup has been made and the contents of the previous posts are available. For reference, they were:
