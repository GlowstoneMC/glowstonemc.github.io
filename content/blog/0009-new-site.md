Hello, fellow Glowstone... ers...?

Welcome to the beta version of the new site! We've decided that the site could use a small facelift and the addition of some much-needed functionality, and this is a preview of what's to come. Some of the things you can look forward to include:

- Better syndication for news
  - Currently, news posts are notified on the forum and across Twitter and Discord, and more can be added easily as required
  - We also have RSS and ATOM feeds available [here](/feeds)
- A proper downloads center for everything Glowstone
  - We haven't done tons of work on this yet, but it'll be coming over the following couple of weeks
- A central location to learn about our community and how you can help with the project, as well as better sourcing for documentation

Currently the beta site is in a relatively early stage, and not everything works. We would appreciate if you are able to give us feedback on this - you can do so on [GitHub](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Site), on [the forums](https://forums.glowstone.net), or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TFJqhsC).

We want to make sure this site will work well for everyone, so don't be afraid to speak up if there's something you don't like!
