Hello again. Today we are releasing Glowstone [2017.8.0](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2017.8.0), which is the last release to support Minecraft 1.12. Since 1.12.1 was released, we will now bump our version to `2017.8.1` which will be released at the end of August (unless Mojang pushes another protocol update).

Since we released [2017.7.0](/news/glowstone-201770/) less than a week ago, not much has changed. Here is the changelog since that release:

### New Features
 - Added Ender Crystals to the end-pillar generation in The End
 - Added support for 17w31a clients

### Fixes
 - Properly handle generators with null spawns (#536)

We are now working on updating Glowstone to 1.12.1, which will be officially supported in the next monthly release (2017.8.1).
