Hello everyone, today we are releasing Glowstone's July release, [2018.7.0](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2018.7.0).

This update is very small, as updating to 1.13 is our priority. You can follow 1.13 development on Pull Requests [#957](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/pull/957) and [#958](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/pull/958).

We recently moved our Maven repository to Sonatype Nexus. Old artifact versions are currently unavailable, but we are working on re-deploying them to the new repository.

## Additions and Changes

  - Updated Glowkit to `1.12.2-R5.0-SNAPSHOT`
  - Updated kotlin to `1.12.51`

## Fixes
