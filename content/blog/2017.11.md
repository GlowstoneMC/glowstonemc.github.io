It is the monthly blog post for Glowstone [2017.11](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2017.11.0), my Glowstoners. For December, we will be working on purging bugs from the server to provide a stable final version for this year. More details will follow soon!

Come say hi and ask questions on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TFJqhsC) <3

This month, we did things:

### Additions

* Added `/setblock` command.
* ... yeah so that's it.



...



Just kidding!

### Changes and Fixes

* Repealed and Replaced chunk key optimization to a system that isn't broken (#586) (Kyureki)
* Fixed a concurrency crash with the Entity AI task manager (#584) (Microsamp)
* Fixed fire not being updated on tick (#435) (kumpelblase2)
* Fixed tools not being damaged when using them
* Cleaned-up and fixed bugs with world borders
* Various code cleanup-ing
* Updated Kotlin to version `1.1.51`

### Other Updates

mastercoms has been working on a new "block/item functions" for a few weeks. It removes the ItemType/BlockType hierarchy which led to multiple issues, and will be replaced by a new system. It will be extendable by plugins to add their new items/blocks with custom functionality. More info can be found in the [PR](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/pull/587).

I was testing [ProtocolSupport](http://protocolsupport.true-games.org/) with the latest version of Glowstone and it was broken. So I [fixed](https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport/pull/748) things. So now you can seamlessly use 1.4.7-to-1.12 clients on Glowstone using the plugin, with build 182 and above!

Also, we are welcoming Kyureki (a.k.a. smartboyathome on GitHub) on our developer team! He recently implemented the `/clone` command, which is currently under review.

Finally, I just wanted to point out that we had a high increase in [traffic](https://i.imgur.com/1Me1dZf.png) on the website and GitHub because we got voted up to the top on Hacker News and the front-page of /r/Minecraft. That's very cool! It wasn't us who posted them, I promise. Thanks for all the stars and love <3


I think I have used all possible variations of "thanks for reading" in the previous posts, so I'm just going to say:

Thanks for reading! :)
