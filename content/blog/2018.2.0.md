Hello everyone, we've released a new monthly update for Glowstone. We are a few days late, but technically if February was just a normal month instead of having 28 days, we wouldn't be _that_ late.

For this release, we had mostly bug fixes with some fine tuning here and there, including some by a few new contributors: Kiulras, jtomlin12 and smcconke!

You can see all the commits and changes [on GitHub](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/compare/2018.1.0...2018.2.0), but here's a summary:

# Additions and changes
* Attributes now support a minimum value (needed for luck)
* GlowSession is now thread safe
* Updated to Netty 4.1.21.Final
* KQueue support added for macOS and BSD native transport
* Improved network buffer management
* Fine tuned ender pearl behavior
* Migrated most unit tests to JUnit Jupiter
* Started fishing implementation
* Improved egg and snowball behavior

# Bug fixes
* Client is now properly updated when an InventoryClickEvent is cancelled
* Fixed a case of jline disabling not working
* Fixed entities being able to pass through blocks that did not fully block light (by first time contributor Kuilras!)
* Fixed a memory leak with the chunk deflater stream
* Fixed some issues with CircleCI builds
* Fixed snow stacking placement (by first time contributor jtomlin!)
* Fire ticks are now reset after death (by first time contributor smcconke!)
* Fixed Glowstone crashing on startup for ARM devices
 
A download for this release can be found on [our website](https://glowstone.net/#downloads). For those of you interested, the LTS release will be coming soon.

Thanks and we hope you enjoy all the changes that went into this release!
