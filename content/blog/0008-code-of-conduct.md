Hello, as part of [our initiative](https://forums.glowstone.net/topic/58/the-glowstone-project) to improve the Glowstone Project, we've released [our first draft](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/blob/9ff0716cce4f30f5c174d319f19681c49dbfecb5/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of our new Code of Conduct. I personally feel that we have outgrown our previous code of conduct, and I'm happy for it. Hopefully this new code of conduct will help grow our community even further and will help foster better and more productive discussion here at Glowstone. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Feel free to even PR changes if you'd like, reply here with suggestions, or just contact me through a medium of your choice.

The final version of the new Code of Conduct will take effect when we release Glowstone 2017.5 on May 31st.

Thanks, and I hope to read your thoughts on this soon!
