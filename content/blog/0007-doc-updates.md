Hello everyone! After releasing our new code of conduct, we've gone on to improve our entire documentation, including our README, contributing docs, plugin dev docs and usage docs! This is a huge undertaking so I hope everyone is ok with this update coming out a bit later. But when these updates do come out, I'd love to see your feedback after you **read the docs**.
