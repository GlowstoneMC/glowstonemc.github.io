Hello everyone! Today we're releasing Glowstone's June release, [Glowstone 2018.6.0](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2018.6.0).

It's one of our smaller releases, but there are some good fixes in here, along with support for more Bukkit events.

## Additions and Changes
* Slime splitting on death (with the SlimeSplitEvent)
* Implemented some API events (#922)
  * EntityRemoveFromWorldEvent (Jacob)
  * PotionSplashEvent
  * EntityShootBowEvent (Mystiflow)
  * EntityTeleportEvent (Jacob)

## Fixes
* Fixed a possible case of entities remaining in vehicles after world removal (Jacob)
* Fixed some commands reporting a failure on permission denial when the Bukkit convention is to report a success
* Fixed block breaking and mining speed inconsistencies
* Fixed beds not breaking completely (VaiTon)
* Fixed beds not having the correct color when dropped (aki-ks)

## Upcoming 

Work has been continuing on our new console system powered by jline 3. We've ported some console only commands to use Bukkit's command system, and removed the Java source code evaluation for now until we address some security concerns. The current blocker is an issue with the console prompt not appearing all, which seems to be a bug in jline 3.

We are also anticipating Minecraft 1.13 to be released in July, along with Bukkit/Spigot/PaperSpigot updates for it. Once those are available, we'll begin work on supporting 1.13.

That's it for this month! You can [download 2018.6.0](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2018.6.0) on GitHub and hopefully we'll have a larger 1.13 update for July's release.
