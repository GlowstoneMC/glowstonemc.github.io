This is an announcement to let everyone know that we have come up with a CLA, otherwise known as a Contributor License Agreement. It's something we've been thinking about doing for a while, but decided that it deserved extra attention in light of [the swift movement on Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/40545454-185-completing-entities-in-glowstone).

CLAs can look a bit scary, but every contributor submitting a pull request to Glowstone will be required to sign it. We've attempted to make that process as easy as possible - going forward, any new pull requests will automatically get a comment from the CLA helper. To sign the CLA, simply click the button in that comment and sign in with GitHub on the CLA helper site.

In short, by signing the Glowstone CLA, you confirm that:

- Anyone can use your contributions anywhere, for free, forever
- Your contributions do not infringe on anyone else's rights, including Mojang's

If you'd like to read the CLA yourself, it's available [here](https://beta.glowstone.net/cla).

Note that we are not requiring previous contributors to sign the CLA, but if you do sign it, it applies retroactively.

If you would like to sign off your own bat before you make any further contributions or do any more work on your forks, feel free to do so [here](https://cla-assistant.io/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone).
