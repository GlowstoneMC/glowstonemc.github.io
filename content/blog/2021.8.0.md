Outside of the repo, we also cleaned up our issues backlog, reducing our open issues (by 10) from 59 to 49, and updating the status of 11 open ones!

## Site

Since we launched our new site 2 months ago, it continues to get upgrades! We've now updated to the latest version of Bulma Sass
and did some minor UI tweaks here and there based on feedback. For developers, we've improved the experience by adding screenshot diffing
to PRs, improved live reload performance, added Sass live reloading, and changed to use relative links.
