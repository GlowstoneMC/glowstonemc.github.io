Hi y'all! Long time no see! This is the first Glowstone release in almost 3 years!

![Glowstone Test Server](/images/test-server.png)

First of all, welcome to our new site! Despite the near identical look, we have switched over
to a static site generator, [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/) served by GitHub Pages.
We used the opportunity to fix and improve some things, but took care to preserve functionality and form.
As a static site, one of the more notable improvements you will see is faster load times, but there's also been some
touch ups to the layout, styling and perhaps most importantly, we finally have our Javadocs back online!

As part of this infrastructure update, we have also taken the forums offline, due to low use, and possible security and maintenance issues.
Worry not though! All our announcements from both the old site, and ones still stuck on the forums have been migrated to this one, and all content has been backed up in case anyone needs it.

Now let's get on to the release notes, and then we'll close off with some project news and updates. Since we did not have a changelog for our prior release, 2018.9.0, we will be including its changes in here.
