Hi everyone, we are releasing Glowstone [2017.8.1](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2017.8.1), which is the first official release to support 1.12.1. Not much has happened since 2017.8.0, but here's the changelog nonetheless:

### Additions
  - Added support for 1.12.1
  - Implemented Experience Orbs
  - Implemented Leashes (#538)
  - Implemented `/effect` command (#555)
  - Added ambient and death sounds for Ender Dragon

  - Started implementation of the Recipe Book, including I/O and network code
  - Implemented API methods related to Lightning (#546)
  - Added burn-time for all burnable items
  - Added option to verify and validate incoming connections (#553)

### Changes and Fixes
  - Fixed animals not spawning at all due to a mistake
  - Optimized function storage using Map instead of List (#537)
  - Fixed some issues with library management, and updated some libraries (#540 and #544)
  - Fixed an issue with player head-rotation not being sent (#551)
  - Fixed an issue with `/tp player toplayer` not doing anything (#554)
  - Fixed shift-clicking in containers, again (#557)

### Other Updates
We've had a slow schedule this month, mostly due to everyone being busier than usual.

I have personally stepped down as project lead and have given this responsibility back to mastercoms because I will have much less time to give to this project due to college and other stuff.

Also, I'd like to welcome Postremus to our development team. He has been working a lot on this project recently and has implemented a lot of major features, including leashes this month.

That's it for now, we'll see you guys later! :^)
