Hello folks, it's been about year since our last update, and we've made plenty of progress since then!
We're currently targeting the latest version of Minecraft, 1.19,
and though we haven't finished support for the largest refactors, we're pretty happy to be past some major roadblocks.

## Glowstone

We've officially retired maintenance of our 1.12 while we focus on the latest development version of Glowstone.

We've also merged in the last few fixes from our 1.12 branch to dev.

### Additions

* We're now fully on Gradle!
    * Though Gradle was added earlier, it still did not have full parity with our Maven builds, nor did it produce all of our required build products
    * Fixed incorrect project version
    * Removed legacy pom.xml
    * Updated `scripts` to use Gradle
    * Updated GitHub Actions to use and cache Gradle properly
    * Enabled parallel builds
    * Added Kotlin and Jacoco
    * Standardized version metadata to be CraftBukkit-esque
    * Date now uses Git commit date rather than build date
    * Fixed meta files being shadowed
    * Added an output which allows for the Minecraft version to be extracted
* Updated to Java 17
    * Update GitHub Actions to be compatible, now using Temurin
* Start to use new API for Material ID handling which respects block data
* XP orbs now drag towards player (#1132)
* Added sheep wool regrowth (#1130)
* Updated to 1.19 API
* Updated to 1.19 protocol (#1139)
* Started to handle new item meta
* Added new API to handle new precondition for ItemStack to use items only
* Optimized images on docs and wbesite

### Changes

* Updated compatibility bundle versioning
* Consolidated ItemTable code to better handle item and block types
* Migrated some Glowkit API extensions to Glowstone
* Updated potion effects to better handle new IDs

### Fixes

  * This partially removes support for [a legacy feature](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone-Legacy/pull/624)
* Fixed some crashes in chunks, ItemTable and biomes
* Fixed various issues with logging compatibility error
* Fixed Java 11+ plugins not loading


## Glowkit

### Additions

* Migrated to fully using paperweight as a Gradle build system
* Added a daily automated upstream API update action
* Updated glowkit script to better handle new build system
* Added output to automatically detect Minecraft version

### Fixes

* Fixed BukkitCommand not being detected as a built-in

## Linkstone

* Updated to latest 1.12 version (not building, help wanted)

## Flow Network

* Updated name from network to flow-network to reduce confusion
* Updated various project files to be up-to-date
* Updated various dependencies to the latest version

## Redstone Transformer

* Fixed various bugs with block data
* Updated build to work without any manual intervention
* Updated data pack handling to be more standards compliant
* Fixed missing block data mapping from empty props map to default state
* Added more validation to block data to verify API and block data parse integrity
* Added support for 1.19 (incomplete for some data types: advancements and loot tables)
