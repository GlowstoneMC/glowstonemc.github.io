Yay, another Glowstone release, 2017.5! This month was dedicated to squashing bugs and implementing a few missing features. However, even with that being our focus, this is one of our biggest releases yet. In [73 commits](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/compare/e09773a3efa75bfb04517061197009072e8f9edd...2d5dca319cb2568859bb9ca7f4f6630fdda36b5b), we changed 125 files with 2,040 additions and 1,138 deletions.

Unfortunately, if you were expecting huge advancements on AI this month, as promised by our 2017.4 announcement, we weren't able to get that done this month :(.  I would expect as our dev team has more free time in the coming months that we will get it done very soon :).

Anyway, without further ado, let's see what we've been up to this month.

### Coming soon

In addition to a big update to the master, we've also been working on things on different branches. Here are a few features that are coming to a master branch near you soon!

* **JLine 3**
Some work has been done to update Glowstone's console input library JLine to version 3, from 2. The branch includes an advanced console Java code interpreter, improved tab completion and better performance, with more to come. Here's [a preview](https://asciinema.org/a/0p8rtk7x13s65yhs4ffzjcn14).
* **1.12**
The next version of Minecraft, 1.12, releases on Friday, but we've been busy [keeping up](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/pull/477) with snapshots and preview releases so that we can be ready to make 1.12 available on Glowstone as soon as possible.
* **Documentation updates**
Although not on a branch yet, we've been drafting changes to the repository documentation files like our README and contributing file. At the same time, we have also been working on a ReadTheDocs style documentation to replace our current GitHub Wiki, which has proven to be ineffective at sharing information with new and long time users alike.
* **New code style and checkstyle rules**
We've informally changed to Google code style (with a few differences) for about a year now. However, this has not been properly enforced. So, we've created [a new branch](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/tree/new-checkstyle) to migrate to this new code style.
* **New code of conduct**
As [announced in May](https://forums.glowstone.net/topic/61/new-code-of-conduct/), we are [changing our code of conduct](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/pull/488) so that we may better support a productive and welcoming community, as well as be clear on enforcement of rules across all of our projects and communication channels.

### Other projects

* **Shine**
[Shine](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Shine) is Glowstone's plugin database for recording plugin compatibility, voting on plugins you'd like to see be made compatible with Glowstone and submitting Glowstone plugins. We've started the project with a Node.js backend and have added authentication and templating support.
* **Bukkit2Sponge**
After more than two years of no code updates, our Bukkit plugin for adding SpongeAPI support to Bukkit servers has been updated for Sponge 6.0.0. We also updated a few project details to bring it more inline with our organization and project updates. However, there is much work to be done to implement API support and as we've [mentioned before](https://forums.glowstone.net/topic/45/about-sponge/7), people in our dev team aren't interested at this time to allocate time and resources to Sponge support. If you're interested in bringing Sponge support to Glowstone, feel free to contribute to [Bukkit2Sponge](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Bukkit2Sponge)!
* **Glowkit**
In the master branch, we've fixed a bug in Sign#getFacing(), thanks to satoshinm. However, most of work has been on [1.12](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowkit/pull/11), where we have simplified patches and done a lot of work to get ready for 1.12.
* **Graal**
In order to provide useful and accessible realtime GPU code translation and offload support to Glowstone without the need to create OpenCL C code, we have started planning modifications to Graal, a Java compiler written in Java, to add GPU compilation support. However, don't get too excited. We don't plan to get any substantial work on this done until a few months from now.

I hope you're as excited as we are about this release! You can find the release downloads [on GitHub](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/releases/tag/2017.5), but please note that we only support the latest version of Glowstone.
