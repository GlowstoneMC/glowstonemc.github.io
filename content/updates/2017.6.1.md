### Project Lead
Due to recent personal life events, **Jessica** (otherwise known as mastercoms) has decided to step down as project lead of Glowstone, after 3 years of continuous devotion for this awesome project. I would like to personally thank her for her immense help and love for this community over the past months and years.

The "core" Glowstone project team consists of **Jessica, myself and Gareth** (a.k.a. gdude2002). This will remain, as Jessica will continue to contribute to Glowstone, but she has decided to let go of her lead responsibilities to focus on other projects and ventures. Since the project still needs a leading entity, I will be taking this responsibility starting this month, and Gareth will continue helping as the project's community lead — he is far more active with the community than I can be.

If you have questions or concerns considering this transition, please feel free to let us know on the forums, Discord, IRC, or privately at your own wish.

### Community Updates

In April, **satoshinm** posted a rather interesting project named [WebSandboxMC](https://forums.glowstone.net/topic/56/websandboxmc-web-based-client-providing-an-interactive-glimpse-of-a-part-of-your-server-using-webgl-html5), which is a WebGL-based in-browser client powered by a Glowstone-compatible Bukkit plugin — essentially allowing you to browse and interact with a Minecraft server directly in the browser.

Over the past month, satoshi has been running a test server to find bugs and missing features in WebSandboxMC and since he's accomplished his goal, the server has been closed. If you're interested in the statistics, you can read all about it in [his recent post](https://forums.glowstone.net/post/256) on the subject.

WebSandboxMC is certainly a very interesting project, and is definitely worth a look by any server admin interested in this kind of interaction!
