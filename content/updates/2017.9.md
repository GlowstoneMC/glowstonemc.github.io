### Other Updates
After a few months of work, we have merged the beta site into production. We have dropped our [Github pages](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/glowstonemc.github.io-legacy2) site in favor of the [Site software](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Site) written in Python by gdude. Please let us know of any problems with the site on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TFJqhsC) or in the repository’s issues.

That’s it for now, see you all again in the next release!
