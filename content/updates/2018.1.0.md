title: Glowstone 2018.1.0 and LTS 2018.0.1

Hi everyone. We are a few days behind schedule, but today we are releasing Glowstone 2018.1 and the complementary LTS update, 2018.0.1.

This month, we worked on a few major features and fixed a lot of bugs.
As explained in the [Year in Review](https://glowstone.net/news/13) news post, we will release two updates every month: an official monthly release containing all of the bleeding-edge features from the last month, and a complementary LTS (long-term-support) release which backports bugfixes to the stable branch.

We also want to thank new contributors XuZhen86, Minecrell and HugoDaBoss for their valuable contributions this month!
