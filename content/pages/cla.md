## 1. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to the Projects' maintainers, contributors, users and to the Glowstone Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your contributions and such derivative works.
