            Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to the Projects' maintainers,
            contributors, users and to the Glowstone Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
            no-charge,

            use,
            offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license
            applies only
            to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contribution or
            by
            combination of your contribution with the project to which this contribution was submitted.

            license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, or
            you have
            clearly identified the source of the contribution and any license or other restriction (like
            related
            patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware.
